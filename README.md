# TestingGrounds
Project as part of Udemy Unreal Course


## Description
Goal right now is to make a game following the course instructions, that resembles titles like
[Amnesia: The Dark Descent](http://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/Amnesia_The_Dark_Descent/ "Amnesia: The Dark Descent"),
[Penumbra Overture](http://store.steampowered.com/app/22180/Penumbra_Overture/ "Penumbra Overture") and others in that series or
[SOMA](http://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/ "SOMA")

Have not decided on exact story or title yet - will update this as I go along with course.
The ultimate goal would be (assuming I like where I get with this) through [Steam Dirrect](https://partner.steamgames.com/?goto=%2Fhome "Steam Dirrect")
and branch away from just the resources provided by this course.
So yeah any feedback is more than welcome so I can figure out wheather it is worth to keep pushing this idea.
